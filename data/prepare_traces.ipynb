      "\n",
      "First, the equation has a square root on one side, which might complicate things. Maybe I can simplify it by making a substitution. Let me think... If I let \\( y = x^2 + 18x + 30 \\), then the equation becomes \\( y = 2 \\sqrt{y + 15} \\), since the expression under the square root is \\( x^2 + 18x + 45 \\), which is 15 more than \\( y \\). That might work. Let me write that down:\n",

      "Okay, so now I can try solving for \\( y \\). Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. But before I do that, I should note that squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I need to check any solutions I get at the end.\n",

Since discriminant is positive, it has two real roots, so the quadratic can take negative values? Wait, no. Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, the quadratic opens upwards. Therefore, it is positive outside the roots and negative between them. Hmm, so actually, the expression under the square root can be negative for some x. Therefore, we have to ensure that \\( x^2 + 18x + 45 \\geq 0 \\). But also, the right-hand side of the original equation is 2 times the square root, so the square root must be real, so the expression inside must be non-negative.

      "x +9 = -sqrt(61), so (x+9)^2 is still 61, so again (x+9)^2 -36 =25. So both expressions under the square root are 25, which is positive. So the square roots are valid. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now check if the original equation holds:\n",

      "Original equation: x² +18x +30 = 2*sqrt(x² +18x +45)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me compute left side for x = -9 + sqrt(61):\n",

      "x² +18x +30. Let's compute x² +18x +30. Let me note that x² +18x +30 = y =10, so that's exactly the substitution we did earlier, so it's 10. The right side is 2*sqrt(25)=10. So that works.\n",

      "Similarly, for x = -9 - sqrt(61):\n",

      "Same thing: x² +18x +30 =10, and the right side is still 10. So both solutions are valid.\n",

      "The product of the roots of the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + 18x + 20 = 0 \\) is given by c/a = 20/1 =20. Alternatively, since the roots are -9 + sqrt(61) and -9 - sqrt(61), their product is (-9)^2 - (sqrt(61))^2 =81 -61=20. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the product is 20. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, just to make sure, let me verify again. Since the original equation was transformed into a quadratic in y, leading to a quadratic in x, but we had to discard one solution for y.

      "Alternatively, is there another way to approach the problem without substitution?\n",

      "Let me try to confirm again. Let me see:\n",

      "\n",
      "\\( u -15 = 2 \\sqrt{u} \\)\n",

      "Then, rearranged:\n",

      "\\( u - 2\\sqrt{u} -15 =0 \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me set \\( z = \\sqrt{u} \\), so that \\( u = z^2 \\). Then equation becomes:\n",

      "\\( z^2 - 2 z -15 =0 \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving for z:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\( z = [2 ± sqrt(4 +60)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(64)]/2 = [2 ±8]/2 \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, z=(2+8)/2=10/2=5, or z=(2-8)/2= -6/2=-3\n",
      "\n",
      "But since \\( z = \\sqrt{u} \\geq 0 \\), so z=-3 is invalid. Thus z=5, so \\( \\sqrt{u}=5 \\implies u=25 \\). So \\( x^2 +18x +45 =25 \\implies x^2 +18x +20=0 \\), which is the same equation as before. So same result. \n",
      "\n",
